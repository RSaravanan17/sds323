# Load the data:
# Click the Import Dataset button under the Environment tab at right.
# Use it to import the data in predimed.csv
# Make sure that:
# - You use "From Text (base)"
# - You check "Yes" next to Heading

# Examine the first few lines of the data frame:
# Each row is a person, each column is a variable.
# variables like group, sex, and smoke are categorical.
# variables like age and bmi are numerical.
head(predimed)

# look at some "favorite stats" for the age variable
favstats(predimed$age)

# Let's get a summary for all the variables in the data set
summary(predimed)

# Make a table for event versus diet group
# xtabs means "cross tabulate" and the tilde (~) means "by"
# This says "cross-tabulate the predimed data by group and event" 
xtabs(~group + event, data=predimed)

# Use this table to estimate:
#  P(event | Control diet) = 97 / 2042 = 0.0475
#  P(event | any MedDiet) = 155 / 4282 = 0.0362
97 / 2042
155 / 4282

# Note: for now you can calculate proportions by using R just like a calculator, e.g. 3/(3+7)
# Later, we'll use slicker commands and tidier syntax...
# Here's a preview:

# Use this table to estimate:
#  P(event | Control diet, Male) = 0.0769
#  P(event | Control diet, Female) = 0.0327
#  P(event | Control diet, Male)
#  P(event | Control diet, Female)
